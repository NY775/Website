<h1>Fast And Furious 3 - review</h1>

<p>Truer words have never been spoken about the Fast and the Furious franchise. Well, who knows if that’s accurate; I’m watching these movies for the first time, so I’m hardly an expert. But I have a fresh perspective, and that fresh perspective leads me to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter how sleek these movies are — without the right people behind the wheel, this ride isn’t worth a damn.

And so, we arrive at The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, the obvious outlier of the franchise. None of the players we’ve come to know and love are here, save for Dom Toretto, who only shows up at the end to more or less turn to the camera and say, “Hey, guys, relax. I’m back. We’re going to fix this.” But that’s it. Just Dom, just for a minute. And it’s a problem.
It doesn’t have to be a problem. Hey, actors get bored, they price themselves out, they get busy with other work — it happens. Whatever the behind-the-scenes reasons for Paul Walker to sit this one out are, there’s no redeeming a bad story and a bad replacement cast. Tokyo Drift flat-tires in both regards, and it starts with leading man Lucas Black as troubled teen Sean Boswell — a 17 year-old, even though Black is 24 and looks even older. That’s warning sign number one.

Sean, a racing enthusiast and a magnet for trouble, travels from America to Japan to live with his dad after winding up in hot water back home, only to get tangled up in an even bigger disaster in Tokyo. He gets caught up in the world of illegal drift racing, mixes up with the Yakuza, befriends a total badass (more on him in a minute), and… uh… hrm. What happens next, again? A whole bunch of teenage nonsense, some admittedly amazing driving sequences, and, from my seat in the house, a whole lot of yawning.

Truth be told, I just finished Tokyo Drift and I’m not sure I can tell you why it exists, other than to keep the Fast and Furious money machine moving. Looks like that mission wasn’t a total failure, but it wasn’t nearly the success story of the first two films. If it can’t even fulfill its job as a cash magnet, then why is it even here?

So, all of that needs to be said up front, before getting into the silver linings — and there are a couple of them, as far as I can see.<br>
This movie is hilarious - the most I've laughed in the past six months. It starts out completely ridiculous and only gets more so, approaching the level of sheer one-dimensional unbelievability within the first two minutes. Hundreds of busty girls, Japanese who don't speak a drop of Japanese, evil mobsters, and hundreds of Maaad Driiifts - this is what makes American cinema great. Every conventional gauge of a good movie fails, but that;s where it suceeds - its so goddarn awful that its incredibly perfect. No joke, Tokyo Drift exceeded every expectation I had, and they were all pretty high.
<br> The film spends way too much on time on cardboard characters and a story that is formulaic and predictable rather than focus on the fun action. This action when focused on doesn’t feel fun and exciting like it kind of did in the first one or like it did in the second but is boring. Some of the visuals are cool and one race is decent but I don’t care. The lack of substance or interesting characters has always been an issue in the franchise buts its especially prominent here when there is no one to attach to and the excessive time we spend with them. The ending to the film will bring in some smiles for reasons if you’ve seen it you know but over that than that there is no point. Hopefully that ending is a promise to do better next time because this film didn’t have a point to being watched. It could work as a spinoff but the franchise hasn’t reached the level where it could earn the right to do a spinoff and even then this wasn’t a decent spinoff. Hopefully next time the franchise gets its act together.</p>
