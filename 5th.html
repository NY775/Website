<h1>Fast And Furious 5 - review</h1>

<p>First, the film has been shot against the picturesque backdrop of Rio, with most of the planning by the glitzy gang being done in the dingy, overcrowded favelas (slums) of the sprawling city. The shoot-outs and the brazen chases are a treat to watch as Diesel and his gang leapfrog across the tenement skyline in gravity-defying splendour.

Secondly, the film has two action giants pitted against each other, which means you are going to get total value for money in the kick-butt department. As if Vin Diesel's bald and brawny machismo wasn't enough, there's hard-rock Dwayne Johnson standing tall as his worthy opponent. The eye-ball to eye-ball confrontations and the gritty physical encounters between the two are the stuff dream AXN cuts are made of. Add to this all that guy bonding between the two (they end up as frenemies) and you have a cops-and-robbers duo that grabs eyeballs from their very first encounter.

And finally, the Fast and Furious franchise works only when its cars revv up furiously and the daredevils drive off to hell....There are enough brazen races here to send your testosterone into a tizzy and keep you glued to your seats, seat belts on. Yes, these guys can do anything with their cars and the cars are archetypal dream machines. Keep guessing the names and go gung-ho on the vroom quotient.
<br>Fast Five. Action packed thrill ride gun firing explosion blowing WOW of a film. You would think that after all the other four films that five would be pushing the sequel's too far. now i can see that, However "Fast Five" is by far the best one out of all of them. i guess because they have put much more money into this film, the budget was an estimated $125,000,000, the film was well advertised and people were more aware of this film coming to the cinema and there was a big "hype" about it coming out. I think the hype towards this film was the audience responding to all the characters from the previous films are now featured together as one "big family" and working together as a team to do this last job. This films got it all, comedy action thrill suspense, muscle and guns and girls in next to nothing washing beautiful cars, i mean seriously can anything top that? watch and see, yet another must see film and will rock your night at the cinema.
<br>This was so much fun, I definitely agree to watching it again and again as there's so much action and really entertaining. its taken the best bits of the series and put it into one. sometimes you have to suspend belief in some of the set pieces but you cant help but go along with the ride. this is what summer is all about, pure entertainment, its the nearest thing to the original, I actually felt I was back in the that cinema way back in 2001 seeing it for the first time. Weather you got a train heist, the rock vs diesel punch up, or a downtown carnage finale its just awesome. </p>
