			<td><p>Magic, a concept used to describe a mode of rationality or way of thinking that looks to invisible forces to influence events,
			effect change in material conditions, or present the illusion of change. Within the Western tradition, this way of thinking is distinct 
			from religious or scientific modes; however, such distinctions and even the definition of magic are subject to wide debate.
			Practices classified as magic include divination, astrology, incantations, alchemy, sorcery, spirit mediation, and necromancy.
			The term magic is also used colloquially in Western popular culture to refer to acts of conjuring and sleight of hand for entertainment. 
			The purpose of magic is to acquire knowledge, power, love, or wealth; to heal or ward off illness or danger; to guarantee productivity or success 
			in an endeavour; to cause harm to an enemy; to reveal information; to induce spiritual transformation; to trick; or to entertain.
			The effectiveness of magic is often determined by the condition and performance of the magician, who is thought to have access to unseen 
			forces and special knowledge of the appropriate words and actions to manipulate those forces.</p></td>

			<td width="70%"> <p> The performance of magic involves words (e.g, spells, incantations, or charms) and symbolic numbers that are thought to
			have innate power, natural or man-made material objects, and ritual actions performed by the magician or other participants. A spell or incantation
			is believed to draw power from spiritual agencies to accomplish magic. Knowledge of spells or symbolic numbers is often secret (occult), and
			the possessor of such knowledge can be either greatly revered or feared. In some cases, the spell is the most highly regarded component of
			the magical rite or ceremony. The Trobriand Islanders of Melanesia, for example, regarded using the right words in the right way as essential 
			to the efficacy of the rite being performed. Among the Maori of New Zealand the power of words is thought to be so important that mistakes in 
			public recitations are believed to cause disasters for individuals or the community. Moreover, like the medieval European charms that used 
			archaic languages and parts of the Latin liturgy, spells often employ an esoteric vocabulary that adds to the respect accorded rites. 
			Belief in the transformative power of words is also common in many religions. Shamans, spirit mediums, and mystics, for example, 
			repeat specific sounds or syllables to achieve an ecstatic state of contact with spiritual forces or an enlightened state of consciousness. 
			Even modern magic for entertainment retains a residual of the spell with its use of the term abracadabra.<p></td>
