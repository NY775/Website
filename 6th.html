<h1>Fast And Furious 6 - review</h1>

<p>As they embark on a mission for their own purposes, the "family" of speed demons soon finds themselves up against Shaw, an enemy that's "in the game" and relies solely on "precision and planning" to carry out their assignments. Letti has lost her memory and we see her become a pawn in Shaw's game for most of the film. Is the family reunited again?

Clocking in at over two hours, the film is filled with all the high-octane speed chases and close combat scenes we've come to expect from the franchise. And while it doesn't disappoint in the outrageously and shamelessly fun bang-em-cars, road rage and the cheesy humour departments, it does drag by taking "detours" and self-discovery trip subplots that could easily have been done without.

Lin's at the helm for the fourth time and the confidence (and over-indulgence, thereof) shows.

The girl-on-girl fight scenes are actually more kick-ass than the ones with the guys. Of the supporting cast, Ludacris has the best lines. The new characters impress.

That being said, this one's purely for fans of the franchise and action junkies alike.<br>
First thing I want to say is I have watched every movie in this franchise! I think this is the best of the whole franchise as of yet. Secondly I am getting so tired of so many negative people posting awful reviews about a movie into the 6th of the films franchise. People need to remember this is for ENTERTAINMENT!!! Not to be "realistic" ffs. It's a movie if you don't like the franchise stop buying tickets to the movies and then posting about how awful you thought it was. I loved the movie and can't wait for the 7th one to come out. I find the whole Jason Statham twist at the end as a great addition! Also hope they get revenge for Han!
<br>Its worth watching movie.
It is the evolution of director Justin Lin.
This will not destroy your expectation for sure.
Rock just Rocked
Should not compare the movie with Fast Five
The climax will blow your mind.
This movie explains how family bondings matter Dom.
I think this was just the beginning of something big to come.

Anybody who watch this one is gonna watch "Fast & Furious 7" for sure
Waiting for the next mass movie .

The Wait is gonna last for 412 days more.
Expecting a bigger one<br>
Ultimately, not quite as good as "Fast Five", but this film has the same style as the previous film and it really works. I had fun with this film, simply because it was not just some random car racing with a dull and lame plot.
<br>The very definition of a chavvy film. There are so many plot holes right from the beginning - nothing is explained! We're not told who any of the characters are, they have little to no development, and the action scenes lack quality and originality. They're just mindless and dumb. The cars are just chavved up American muscle with fake sounds. There's just so much wrong with this film it's hard to get it across in a review, it's ridiculous right from the start - even for an action film. I mean, a car chase through London is impossible at anything above 10 mph, the whole story is disjointed. Nobody's motive is explained thoroughly, nor is there any sophistication in the action and chases. I can't think of how this film could be worse!
