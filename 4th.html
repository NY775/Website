<p>Diesel power explodes once again, after having vroomed off into anonymity for the last eight years. The alluring speed devil, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel), who became a cult figure in the first Fast and Furious, turned his back to the two sequels that followed (2Fast 2Furious and Tokyo Drift) due to fee problems. The franchise lost its zing and Vin almost vanished from the screen. So, naturally, the two had to get together again and create grease lightnin' once more.
But Dom doesn't return alone. In comes his nemesis too, FBI agent Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrated ex-con Dom's gang in the first film, only to betray him and his sister (Jordana Brewster). But Brian and Dom do share a special bond, despite being on opposite sides of the law. Remember how Brian let Dom go in the first film. It's the same love-hate relationship that forms the crux of the fourth sequel, where both are in for a roller-coaster ride that sees them criss-crossing across unfriendly terrain in their shining machines. While Dom wants to avenge the death of his girl friend (Michelle Roderiguez), Brian is in hot pursuit of a drug lord, Antonio Braga, who smuggles car loads of heroin across the Mexican border under the guise of street car racing.

While our vote would still stand for the first film, the fourth is definitely better than part two and three. Needless to say, the action revs up the adrenaline as the racers spin their cars through unbelievable hooks and curves with unflappable calm. But beyond the horsepower, there is the enigmatic characterisation of Vin Diesel as the good-bad Dom, who keeps you guessing about his ethics till the very end. Get your testosterone kick.
<br>Over zealous? No. An amazing piece of art? Most definitely. Fast & Furious picks up not too long after the first film, The fast and the furious( Which I can say is nothing compared to this.) This film brings everybody back together for another high-octane, sweat inducing ride. This film, like the other involves a multitude of different emotion's. Anger, frustration, deception, love and friendship. But the fourth installment of the Fast and the Furious series takes a more dramatic and plot driven approach than the other films. The other films relied on hot women and hot cars to get the job done, this one on the other hand doesn't, it use a more focus on it's plot and story rather than the style and the action( albeit there is ALLOT in this movie.) But the film it self is very well done and well acted too(Paul Walker did much better here than the first two.) Also this installment brings back Justin Lin as the director( He directed Tokyo drift.) this is his second outing, and may I say his finest directing yet, Lin brings his own personal style to the film, he puts a intricate plot and mixes it with heart-stopping action ( unlike Cohen he relies on action, not plot or story) that's why this film has broken the record of it's predecessor's for biggest opening weekend. Fast and furious brings this series to a whole new level, and has gone form a likable action film to an amazing action drama that you won't forget, this movie is just like the title say's, Fast and Furious.</p>
